# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

My website accomplishes the goal of creating a random password through generating a custom password that takes user input for numbers, special characters, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters. The use can check different boxes that add/remove certain character types. Through making this project, I learned how to correctly write javascript to accomplish seperate goals. For example, I made a event listner that checks to see if my checkboxes are checked and if the generate button is clicked.

## Installation

To install my project, open the url of the website; there, you will be meet with a screen with checkboxes for different characters you want in your password. 

## Usage

To use, simply click what you want in your password and the length of the password, then click generate button. A string of text will appear with a random password. Copy the password using copy and paste, then your done!
